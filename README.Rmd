# puller

(WIP) puller is a package to provide a high-level interface for data scientists
to get data from Azure for reproducible data analysis work. It implements an
opinionated workflow to minimize the amount of time you need to spend
configuring cloud resources, so that you can focus on your analysis.

The basic workflow is: write a query on a database, run it and export the
results to Blob Storage, download a copy to your machine and run the rest of
your R script against it, while using Azure Key Vault to authenticate to Azure
without having to store secret keys.

With this workflow you can run your script on
multiple machines without having to rerun the query on the source database
because the results you want are cached in Blob storage.
If the source data upstream changes or gets deleted, you can still
reproduce your analysis because you have the dataset.

## Features 

- [x] Log into Azure via the CLI
- [ ] Export data to Azure Blob Storage from a Kusto query
- [ ] Export data to Azure Blob Storage from a SQL query via Kusto using
  `sql_request()`
- [ ] Export data to Azure Blob Storage from an Azure SQL database (will require
  C/C++ code to put access token into connection arguments because
  rodbc/nanodbc doesn't support this)
- [ ] Helper to download data from blob to local
- [ ] {targets} integration

## Installation

You can install the development version of puller from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
